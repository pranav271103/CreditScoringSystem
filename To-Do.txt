# Problem statement #1

### **`NOTE: Candidates `MUST` submit solution in the google form provided below.`**

### Your Challenge

You are provided with sample 100K raw, transaction-level data from the Aave V2 protocol. Each record corresponds to a wallet interacting with the protocol through actions such as `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`, `redeemunderlying`, and `liquidationcall`.

Your task is to develop a robust machine learning model that assigns a **credit score between 0 and 1000** to each wallet, based solely on historical transaction behavior. Higher scores indicate reliable and responsible usage; lower scores reflect risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.

Decide which features to engineer from DeFi transaction data
Implement a one-step script that generates wallet scores from a json file which contains the a small sample of user-transactions.

Validate and explain the score logic in a one-page README for transparency and extensibility.

### Link to the user-transactions json file:

The below file is raw json file (~87MB)

Or if you prefer the compressed zip file (~10MB)

### Deliverables

- Github repo containing all the code written, with [readme.md](http://readme.md) and [analysis.md](http://analysis.md)
- Include readme file explaining the method chosen, complete architecture, processing flow.
- Create a new file called [analysis.md](http://analysis.md) and after scoring all the wallets add analysis on the wallets scored, include score distribution graph across the ranges from 0-100,100-200, etc. Behavior of wallets in the lower range, behavior of wallets in the higher range.
